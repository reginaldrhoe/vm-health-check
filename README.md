## Project: VM Health Checker
Disk, Memory, Health Metrics, Logging

### Steps to Run the Script

#### Save the Script:
1. Open a text editor and paste the modified script into a new file.
2. Save the file as `health_check.ps1`.

#### Make Sure Execution Policy is Set:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and set the execution policy if you haven't already:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Run the Script:

Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you saved health_check.ps1.
Run the script by typing:
.\health_check.ps1



Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup

Create Your Repo: Start by creating a new GitHub repository named vm-health-check. Initialize it with a README and a .gitignore for shell scripts.
Folder Structure: Organize your files with a clear folder structure, e.g., scripts/health_check.sh and docs/usage.md.
Version Control: Commit changes regularly with meaningful messages to track script improvements.

Step 2: Script Structure Overview

Shell Script Entry Point: Create a health_check.sh file with a main() function. Use modular functions for CPU, memory, and disk checks.
Argument Parsing: Support --explain using a case block or getopts to trigger a verbose summary mode.
Execution Flow: Check parameters, run health checks, generate output, and optionally display explanations.

Step 3: CPU Health Check

CPU Usage Monitoring: Use top, mpstat, or /proc/stat to gather CPU usage. For example: top -bn1 | grep 'Cpu(s)'.
Set Thresholds: Compare current usage against a defined threshold (e.g., 85%) to determine health status.
Script Snippet:
if (($(echo "$cpu > 85" | bc -l))); then
    echo "High CPU usage"
fi



Step 4: Memory Health Check

Capture Memory Usage: Use free -m to retrieve memory statistics and calculate usage: used/total * 100.
Set Safe Threshold: A usage over 90% might indicate memory pressure. Flag as 'Warning' or 'Critical' accordingly.
Script Snippet:
mem_usage=$(free | awk '/Mem/ { printf("%.2f", $3/$2 * 100.0) }')



Step 5: Disk Space Check

Gather Disk Usage: Use df -h / or df --output=pcent / | tail -1 to get the root filesystem's usage percentage.
Threshold Alerts: Mark disks as unhealthy if usage exceeds, say, 80%. Show warnings in red or bold terminal output.
Script Snippet:
disk_usage=$(df / | awk 'END { print $5 }' | sed 's/%//')



Step 6: Combine All Health Metrics

Unified Health Logic: Run all three checksâ€”CPU, memory, and diskâ€”and aggregate their results into a single status report.
Visual Output: Use colors and symbols (âˆš /! /X) to show system health per category.
Return Codes: Return specific exit codes (0: OK, 1: Warning, 2: Critical) to allow integration with cron or monitoring systems.

Step 7: Implement --explain Argument

Extended Output Mode: Add logic to detect --explain and display verbose descriptions for each metric's status.
Human-Friendly Language: Translate raw values into plain language. For example, 'CPU usage is above threshold. This may affect performance.'
Optional JSON or Markdown: Support output in structured formats for integration with monitoring tools or dashboards.

Step 8: Add Logging & Formatting

Log Important Events: Use logger or redirect output to a log file for tracking script execution and results.
Terminal Aesthetics: Use ANSI color codes for red (critical), yellow (warning), and green (healthy) statuses to improve readability.
Error Handling: Include fallback logic for missing tools or malformed inputs to make the script robust.

Step 9: Test Across VM Types

Run on Different Environments: Test the script on small, medium, and large VMs to ensure thresholds are realistic across contexts.
Validate --explain Output: Check if the extended output works as expected across varied loads and edge cases.
Automate Testing: Use cron jobs or CI pipelines to run and verify health checks periodically.
